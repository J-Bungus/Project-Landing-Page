Landing Page
---

This is a project from the introductory course from The Odin Project.

Through this project, I will practice using HTML and CSS to design a webpage. More specifically, I will learn the process of creating a relatively complicated webpage from scratch and familiarize myself with the flexbox layout in CSS.

I will practice using Git to commit changes and writing good commit messages.
